def RawHRVMeas(x: Union[list, np.ndarray]) -> dict:
    """
    Compute Poincaré plot-based HRV (Heart Rate Variability) measures from RR interval time series.

    This function computes the triangular histogram indices and Poincaré plot measures commonly used 
    in HRV analysis. It is specifically designed for time series consisting of consecutive RR intervals 
    measured in milliseconds. It is not suitable for other types of time series.

    The computed features are widely used in clinical and physiological studies of autonomic nervous 
    system activity. The Poincaré plot measures (SD1 and SD2) are standard metrics for short- and 
    long-term variability, while the triangular indices provide geometric summaries of the RR 
    distribution.

    Compute the POLVARd measure of a time series.

    The POLVARd (also called Plvar) measure quantifies the probability of 
    obtaining a sequence of consecutive ones or zeros in a symbolic sequence 
    derived from the input time series.

    This measure was originally introduced in:
        Wessel et al., "Short-term forecasting of life-threatening cardiac 
        arrhythmias based on symbolic dynamics and finite-time growth rates",
        Phys. Rev. E 61(1), 733 (2000).

    The original implementation applied this measure to RR interval sequences 
    (typically in milliseconds), with the symbolic threshold `d` representing 
    raw amplitude differences. This implementation generalizes it to 
    z-scored time series, such that `d` is specified in units of standard deviation.

    The function is derived from the MATLAB implementation by Max A. Little 
    (2009) and Ben D. Fulcher.

    This measure is commonly used in clinical HRV analysis. It is not appropriate
